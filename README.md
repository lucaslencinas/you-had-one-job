# You Had One Job

## Description

Web app that hosts a multiplayer game where players play in teams to complete tasks or challenges. The main vision of these games is that each player controls only one piece of the game being played.
Players could play Tetris by collaborating with each other to control the Tetris game: one person controls the left button, another controls the right button, another one controls the down button, and the last one controls the rotation button.
